## Project Structure


### Detailed Breakdown:

- **`HOUSEHOLD_SERVICES/`**: Contains the core functionality of the app, including routes, models, templates, and static files.
  - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask app and its extensions like SQLAlchemy, Migrate, etc.
  - **`models.py`**: Contains the ORM models for users, services, and other entities.
  - **`app.py`**: Defines the URL routes for customer, professional, and admin views, as well as other necessary views.
  - **`templates/`**: Stores HTML templates for rendering pages.
  - **`static/`**: Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images, organized in respective subdirectories.

  - **`migrations/`**: Contains the migration files for database schema changes.
  - **`versions/`**: Folder where Alembic migration scripts are stored. This is automatically created when running `flask db migrate`.

  - **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
  
  - **`run.py`**: The entry point to run the Flask app. It imports the app from `app/__init__.py` and runs it.
  
  - **`README.md`**: The project documentation, which provides an overview of the app, installation instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.

### Why this Structure is Improved:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: The structure organizes code based on responsibilities. The `app` directory holds the core app logic, templates, and static files, while the `migrations` directory handles database migrations. This makes it easier to maintain and scale.
2. **Modularity**: The related code is grouped together, allowing for easier navigation and extensibility.
3. **Scalability**: The structure is designed to easily scale with additional features, like adding new routes, forms, and utility functions.
4. **Maintainability**: With clear separations between models, views, templates, and static files, this structure is more maintainable as your app grows.

## Database Setup

- **SQLite**: The app uses SQLite for simplicity and lightweight operation. 
- To switch to a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL), modify the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in `app.py`.
